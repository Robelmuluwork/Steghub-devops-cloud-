## AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY TECHNOLOGY
  
## Starting Off Your AWS Cloud Project
  
There are few requirements that must be met before you begin:

1. Properly configure your AWS account and Organization Unit [Watch How To Do This Here](https://youtu.be/9PQYCc_20-Q)

- Create an AWS Master account. (Also known as Root Account) 
- Within the Root account, create a sub-account and name it DevOps. (You will need another email address to complete this)
1.1.  In the AWS Management Console, navigate to AWS Organizations.

1.2. If you haven't already created an organization, click "Create an organization" and select "Enable All Features".
1.3. Click "Add account".
1.4. Select "Create account".
1.5. Fill in the required details:
 - Account name: DevOps
 - Email address: Provide a new email address (different from the root account).
1.6. Click "Create". AWS will send a verification email to the provided email address.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/768ac497-35a3-4536-bba6-5109bc8d5b0a)


1.7. Verify the email address by following the instructions in the email sent by AWS.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52b4dfc2-6adb-43b2-b8e1-244806653619)



- Within the Root account, create an AWS Organization Unit (OU). Name it Dev. (We will launch Dev resources in there)
  
  **Create an Organizational Unit (OU) Named Dev**  > **In the AWS Organizations dashboard, click on "Organize accounts"** > **Click on "Create organizational unit"** > **Enter Dev as the name for the new OU** > **Click "Create organizational unit"**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bec6149b-3573-428c-8274-9ae5842e1248)


- Move the DevOps account into the Dev OU.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be883c0c-6735-4d5d-82a6-17c09d815113)


- Login to the newly created AWS account using the new email address.
   - Go to the AWS Management Console login page.
   - Enter the email address used for the DevOps account and click Next.

2. Create a free domain name for your fictitious company.you can use [cloudns](https://www.cloudns.net/) for free

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beab4332-6bea-4eaf-9e15-40057f4c1b0d)



3. Create a hosted zone in AWS, and map it to your free domain.

 In the search bar, type `Route 53` and select `Route 53` from the results. >  In the Route 53 dashboard, click on `Hosted zones` in the left-hand navigation pane >
 Click `Create hosted zone`
Fill in the following details:
   -  Domain name: Enter your Freenom domain name (e.g., example.tk).
   -  Comment: Optional.
   -  Type: Select Public hosted zone.
   -  VPC: Leave this blank for a public hosted zone.
   -  Click Create hosted zone

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7ac479f-be63-4745-9b44-5b04131fb2a0)


 Go to the domain name provider and edit the nameservers

Transfer the (4 server address) in the hostname zone in the (NS column) to the domain provider (nameservers).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0fd72ec-ff2a-446c-9c1c-37e4cb699184)


The next step is to get a certificate from AWS Certificate Manager. The reason we are creating a certificate first is because when creating `ALB` we need to select a certificate.

- Click on request a Cert > Request public cert > Next

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dbe434b-857e-46d2-8f8d-71007a1c842a)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6674e36-2dba-44ed-8a6e-efa25d6cf191)



In the domain name, we are going to use a wild card i.e(*.). should in case we want to have another `name` or `subdomain`, the `WILDCARD` will make sure that any name before the domain name is attached to the `certificate`. 
e.g robelM.fictitiouscompany.ip-ddns.com

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/363a1d70-1e8d-4895-bab0-ec7660771162)



NOTE: Because we are using DNS verification is going to automatically write to the Rout53 to confirm

![image](assets/project15_14_certificate_details.JPG)

> NOTE : As you proceed with configuration, ensure that all resources are appropriately tagged, for example:

Project: Give your project a name `Project-15`

Environment: `dev`

Automated:`No` (If you create a recource using an automation tool, it would be `Yes`)


## SET UP A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK (VPC)

Set Up a Virtual Private Network (VPC)
Always make reference to the architectural diagram and ensure that your configuration is aligned with it.

1. Create a [VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dd9e713-afec-4aba-aa0a-ab9721b354e4)


9. Create a Security Group for:


- **Nginx Servers**: Access to Nginx should only be allowed from a Application Load balancer (ALB). At this point, we have not created a 
load balancer, therefore we will update the rules later. For now, just create it and put some dummy records as a place holder.

- **Bastion Servers**: Access to the Bastion servers should be allowed only from workstations that need to SSH into the bastion servers.
Hence, you can use your workstation public IP address. To get this information, simply go to your terminal and type 
curl www.canhazip.com

- **Application Load Balancer**: ALB will be available from the Internet give it both HTTPS and HTTP from anywhere 0.0.0.0/0

- **Webservers** : Access to Webservers should only be allowed from the Nginx servers. Since we do not have the servers created yet, just put some dummy records as a place holder, we will update it later.

- **Data Layer** : Access to the Data layer, which is comprised of Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Amazon Elastic File 
System (EFS) must be carefully desinged â€“ only webservers should be able to connect to RDS, while Nginx and Webservers will have 
access to EFS Mountpoint.

**Proceed With Compute Resources**
You will need to set up and configure compute resources inside your VPC. The recources related to compute are:

- EC2 Instances
- Launch Templates
- Target Groups
- Autoscaling Groups
- TLS Certificates
- Application Load Balancers (ALB)

## Set Up Compute Resources for Nginx  Provision EC2 Instances for Nginx

1. Create an EC2 Instance based on CentOS Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in any 2 Availability Zones (AZ) in any AWS Region 
(it is recommended to use the Region that is closest to your customers). Use EC2 instance of T2 family (e.g. t2.micro or similar)

## CONFIGURE APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER (ALB) Application Load Balancer To Route Traffic To NGINX
Nginx EC2 Instances will have configurations that accepts incoming traffic only from Load Balancers. No request should go directly
to Nginx servers. With this kind of setup, we will benefit from intelligent routing of requests from the `ALB` to Nginx servers 
across the 2 `Availability Zones`. We will also be able to `offload SSL/TLS certificates` on the ALB instead of Nginx. Therefore, 
Nginx will be able to perform faster since it will not require extra compute resources to validate certificates for every request.

1. Create an Internet facing ALB

Open the Amazon EC2 console > Navigate to Load Balancers under the Load Balancing section > Click Create Load Balancer and select Application Load Balancer >  Configure the ALB > 

- Name: Enter a name for your ALB
- Scheme: Choose Internet-facing
- IP address type: Choose ipv4
- Listeners: Add a listener for HTTPS (port 443).
- Availability Zones: Select the appropriate VPC and Availability Zones (AZs). Ensure that the ALB is created within subnets that have internet access.

## Application Load Balancer To Route Traffic To Web Server
Since the webservers are configured for auto-scaling, there is going to be a problem if servers get dynamically scalled out or in. 
Nginx will not know about the new IP addresses, or the ones that get removed. Hence, Nginx will not know where to direct the traffic.

To solve this problem, we must use a load balancer. But this time, it will be an internal load balancer. Not Internet facing since
the webservers are within a private subnet, and we do not want direct access to them.


1. Create an Internal ALB

2. Ensure that it listens on HTTPS protocol (TCP port 443)

### Setup EFS
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic Network File System (NFS) for use with
AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. In this project, we will utulize EFS service and mount filesystems on both Nginx 
and Webservers to store data.

1. Create an EFS filesystem

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c66ec938-e11d-4374-aca8-b2d3d87c4089)



2. Create an EFS mount target per AZ in the VPC, associate it with both subnets dedicated for data layer
3. Associate the Security groups created earlier for data layer.

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed distributed relational database service by Amazon Web Services. 
This web service running in the cloud designed to simplify setup, operations, maintenans & scaling of relational databases. 
Without RDS, Database Administrators (DBA) have more work to do, due to RDS, some DBAs have become jobless

To ensure that your databases are highly available and also have failover support in case one availability zone fails, we will 
configure a multi-AZ set up of RDS MySQL database instance. In our case, since we are only using 2 AZs, we can only failover to
one, but the same concept applies to 3 Availability Zones. We will not consider possible failure of the whole Region, but for 
this AWS also has a solution â€“ this is a more advanced concept that will be discussed in following projects.

To configure RDS, follow steps below:

1. Create a subnet group and add 2 private subnets (data Layer)

2. Create an RDS Instance for mysql 8.*.*

3. To satisfy our architectural diagram, you will need to select either Dev/Test or Production Sample Template. But to minimize AWS 
cost, you can select the Do not create a standby instance option under Availability & durability sample template (The production 
template will enable Multi-AZ deployment)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3c9db1f-94c3-47fb-866d-218a6706cbc5)


4. Configure other settings accordingly (For test purposes, most of the default settings are good to go). In the real world, you will
need to size the database appropriately. You will need to get some information about the usage. If it is a highly transactional 
database that grows at 10GB weekly, you must bear that in mind while configuring the initial storage allocation, storage autoscaling, 
and maximum storage threshold.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1665802b-387e-43c3-8ff8-8e3325b4664c)



5. Configure VPC and security (ensure the database is not available from the Internet)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ac9b4df-1679-4323-b92a-be7af32c9992)



6. Configure backups and retention

7. Encrypt the database using the KMS key created earlier
S![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c1cf718-cc9c-414f-ac8a-90fdc6db7e59)



8.Enable CloudWatch monitoring and export Error and Slow Query logs (for production, also include Audit)

> Note This service is an expensinve one. Ensure to review the monthly cost before creating. **(DO NOT LEAVE ANY SERVICE RUNNING FOR LONG)Create other records such as CNAME, alias and A records**

**NOTE:** You can use either CNAME or alias records to achieve the same thing. But alias record has better functionality because it is 
a faster to resolve DNS record, and can coexist with other records on that name. Read here to get to know more about the differences.


- Create an alias record for the root domain and direct its traffic to the ALB DNS name.
- Create an alias record for tooling.<yourdomain>.com and direct its traffic to the ALB DNS name.

You need to ensure that the main domain for the WordPress website can be reached, and the subdomain for Tooling website can also be 
reached using a browser.
